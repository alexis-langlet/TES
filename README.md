# TES, the Time Entry Sender

TES is a project aiming to ease time entry creation on Redmine.
As such it was specifically created for this software and will not work with any other. 

## Usage

Create a .env file based on the .env.example with your custom values, build it and run it ;)
The interface should be pretty easy to understand, just keep in mind that everything related to username password or api token reference Redmine's ones and will never be stored or used in anyway.
